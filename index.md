## About Me

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** in the [OSCAR Group](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/) at the **University of Oxford**, led by [Prof. Amro Awad](https://www.amroawad.org/). My research focuses on **secure computer architecture**, **memory hierarchy**, **confidential computing**, and **deep-learning accelerators**.

I received my Ph.D. in Electronic and Computer Science from the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/) (2022-2025), fully funded by the UKRI Research Scholarship. My doctoral research focused on **machine learning-enhanced on-chip network security** for heterogeneous computing systems, supervised by [Dr. Basel Halak](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5x7sls/doctor-basel-halak) and [Dr. Ahmad Atamli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-atamli/) (Senior Distinguished Architect at NVIDIA).

Prior to my Ph.D., I gained extensive industry experience as a **Senior Silicon Design Engineer** at AMD (GPU IP Design for MI300) and as a **SoC Design Engineer** at United Imaging Healthcare. I hold an M.Sc. in Analogue and Digital IC Design from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) with Distinction.

## Research Interests

- **Secure Computer Architecture:** Hardware security, confidential computing (ARM CCA, AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX)
