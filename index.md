## About Me

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** in the [OSCAR Group](https://www.oscar-ox.com/) at the **University of Oxford**, led by [Prof. Amro Awad]. My research focuses on **secure computer architecture**, **confidential computing**, **memory hierarchy**, and **deep learning accelerators**.

I received my Ph.D. in Electronic and Computer Science from the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/) (2022-2025), fully funded by the UKRI Research Scholarship. My doctoral research focused on **machine learning-enhanced on-chip network security for heterogeneous computing systems**, supervised by [Dr. Basel Halak] and [Dr. Ahmad Atamli] (Senior Distinguished Architect at NVIDIA).I hold an M.Sc. in Analogue and Digital IC Design from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

I gained extensive industry experience as a **Research Scientist Internship** at Alibaba DAMO Academy during my Ph.D., and as a **Senior Silicon Design Engineer** at AMD (GPU IP Design for MI300) prior to my Ph.D.

## Research Interests

- **Secure Computer Architecture:** Hardware security, confidential computing
- **Memory Hierarchy:** Near-memory computing, access control, permission checking
- **Network-on-Chip (NoC) Security:** Intrusion detection, hardware Trojan mitigation, adaptive routing
