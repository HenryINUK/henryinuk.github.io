## About Me

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** in the [Oxford Secure Computer Architecture Research (OSCAR) Group](https://www.oscar-ox.com/) at the **University of Oxford (Univ College)**, led by Prof. Amro Awad. My research focuses on **secure computer architecture**, **confidential computing**, **memory hierarchy**, and **deep learning accelerators**.

I received my Ph.D. in Electronic and Computer Science from the University of Southampton (2022-2025), fully funded by the UKRI Research Scholarship. My doctoral research focused on **machine learning-enhanced on-chip network security for heterogeneous computing systems**, supervised by [Dr. Basel Halak](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5x8ggp/doctor-basel-halak#research) and [Dr. Ahmad Atamli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-atamli-phd-atamli-54402485/) (Senior Distinguished Architect at NVIDIA). I hold an M.Sc. in Analogue and Digital IC Design from Imperial College London.

I gained extensive industry experience as a **Research Scientist Intern** mentored by [Dr. Shuangchen Li](https://shuangchenli.github.io/) at Alibaba DAMO Academy during my Ph.D., and as a **Senior Silicon Design Engineer** at AMD prior to my Ph.D.
